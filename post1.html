                    <p>DEFENDING Champions University of the Cordilleras and the University of Baguio gave a set apiece each but none the less took a game ahead in their best of three finals series of volleyball in Baguio – Benguet Educational Athletic League season 30. The Lady Cardinals, gunning for a rare four peat, stifle the UC Lady Jaguars 25-18, 25-15, 21-25, 25-17 at the UB Gym Thursday evening while the reigning men’s titlist Jaguars, despite giving up the first set went on to be UB, 22-25, 25-22, 25-15 and 25-15. “Medyo nagrelax lang sa third,” said setter Cherry Atuban resulting to the team’s only second set loss in the BBEAL. Leading 14-12, UB went on a series of errors, including service miscues that saw UC race to a 7-0 blast and a 19-14 lead. A 3-0 run saw the Lady Cardinals just two points down, 21-23. But they lost gas to give up the set. The Lady Cardinals however regrouped and went on a scoring rampage to lead 8-1 in the fourth canto and appeared they will easily coast to the match point. But UC had another thing in mind as it came to within three, 11-14, after back to back miscues of Belle Belsa and Mary Anne Atuban. But Hannah Relox easily dropped the ball at the other side to give UB a four point breather, 15-11. Relox then made it an eight point affair before two Cardinal errors that saw the Jaguars trimmed the deficit by two, 22 - 16.</p>

                    <p>Dianne Bautista gave UB the chance to finish them off with a service error, 24 - 17, with Nicole Guyguyon concluded the game with a service ace. “They gave their all but still fell short. But I’m happy with their performance. Sana mas gandahan pa nila next game,” said UC center for sports development head Danilo Cong-o. In the men’s contest UB was at its peak in the first set as the Cardinals escaped the Jaguars. When UC zoomed to a 7-1 lead in the second set, UB rallied to within two, 5-7, then at 14-16, as coach Henry Esquejo sued for time out for the defending champion. UB came to within one, 21-22, but relinquished the said canto. UC needed a 5-0 blast in the third set to take a 17-10 lead and never looked back. “We were supposed to beat them in three sets, but then you allowed them to take the first. I just do hope that you will take that to heart,” added Cong-o. As of this writing, game 2 of the men’s and women finals are being played at the UC Gym after the third place battle between Saint Louis University and the Benguet State University. Meanwhile, the SLU Lady Navigators cruised past Cordillera Career Development College to salvage third place anew. (With a report from Jean Ananayo/UC Intern)</p>
